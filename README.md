Hi there! I'm Patrick Wei, a G12 Ontario High School student interested in robotics, math, and engineering! Always looking forward to meeting new people and learning new things. Nice to meet you!

Here you'll find a lot of school projects I've made through G11, G12, and AP Computer Science. Working on lots of stuff behind the scenes :).
