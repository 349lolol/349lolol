Hi there! I'm Patrick Wei, a G12 Ontario High School student interested in robotics, math, and engineering! Always looking forward to meeting new people and learning new things. Nice to meet you!

Here you'll find a lot of school projects I've made through G11, G12, and AP Computer Science, mainly in Java but also using other languages like JS. Robotics repos (C++) will have to stay private for security reasons, but feel free to reach out if you need any advice, I'd be more than happy to help out. Lots of projects coming along too, they'll be public once they're completed :)
